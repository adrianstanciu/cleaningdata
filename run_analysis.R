## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Prepares a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis

## Steps:
## 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
## measurement. 
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
## with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Before running, please manually set working directory
## to the location of this source file
## and ensure the test data is in a sub-folder called "UCI_HAR_Dataset"


## Reads the training and test sets, merges them, adds columns for activity 
## and subject, and writes the result to disk the result in table format
